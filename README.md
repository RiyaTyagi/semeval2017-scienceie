> **Abstract:** This paper describes our approach to the SemEval 2017 Task 10: "Extracting Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications", specifically to Subtask (B): "Classification of identified keyphrases".
> We explored three different deep learning approaches: a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN), a stacked learner with an MLP meta-classifier, and an attention based Bi-LSTM. From these approaches, we created an ensemble of differently hyper-parameterized systems, achieving a micro-F1-score of 0.63 on the test data. Our approach ranks 2nd (score of 1st placed system: 0.64) out of four according to this official score. 
> However, we erroneously trained 2 out of 3 neural nets (the stacker and the CNN) on only roughly 15% of the full data, namely, the original development set. When trained on the full data (training+development), our ensemble has a micro-F1-score of 0.69.

## Project structure

* `code/`
   * `crawl/` -- this folder contains scripts to crawl additional Elsevier articles
   * `skip-thoughts/` -- document classifier, incorporating code from https://bitbucket.org/TomKenter/siamese-cbow/src
* `data/` -- the data can be obtained from the shared task website: https://scienceie.github.io/resources.html
* `scripts_submission/` -- shell scripts for running the individual systems
* `scripts/` -- evaluation scripts provided by the task organizers
* `requirements.txt` -- a text file with the names of the required Python modules

## Requirements

* 64-bit Linux versions (not tested on other platforms)
* Python 2.7
* Python modules in the `requirements.txt` file
* [keras] with [tensorflow] or [theano]
* Suitable word embeddings in **text format** (see below)

## Running the experiments

To run the experiments described in our paper you have to aquire following resources.

Put the following embeddings into `data/embeddings`:
* Glove word embeddings: [glove] (glove.6B.zip and glove.42B.300d.zip)
* Komninos word embeddings: [komninos] (wiki_extvec.gz)
* Levy word embeddings: [levy] (Bag of Words (k = 2) [words])

Put the training, dev and test data into `data/train`, `data/dev` and `data/test`, respectively. For running the experiment scripts below, also create `data/combined`, and copy the `train` and `dev` data into it.
* Training and test data: [science-ie-data]

Further, the keras version has a bug regarding unicode, which has to be fixed as e.g. described in [keras-fix].

The scripts to start the experiments can be found in `scripts_submission`.
